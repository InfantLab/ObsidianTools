# File Organization - Folder Selection Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The File Organization tool now supports selecting specific top-level folders to organize, rather than only organizing the entire vault.

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Scope Selection**
Users can now choose between:
- **🌍 Entire Vault**: Organize all files in the vault (original behavior)
- **📁 Specific Folder**: Select and organize files from a specific folder

### 2. **Intelligent Folder Discovery**
- **Recursive scanning**: Finds all directories and subdirectories
- **System folder filtering**: Automatically excludes `.obsidian`, `.git`, `node_modules`, etc.
- **Organized folder exclusion**: Skips previously organized folders to prevent conflicts

### 3. **Interactive Folder Selection**
- **Browse interface**: Shows all available folders in a clean list
- **Relative paths**: Displays folder paths relative to vault root for clarity
- **Pagination**: Handles large folder lists with scrollable interface

### 4. **Preview and Confirmation**
- **File count preview**: Shows exactly how many markdown files will be organized
- **Confirmation prompt**: Requires user confirmation before proceeding
- **Clear information**: Displays target folder and file count before organization

## 🔄 Usage Flow

### Step 1: Access File Organization
```
Main Menu → 📁 Organize Files
```

### Step 2: Choose Scope
```
? What would you like to organize?
❯ 🌍 Entire Vault
  📁 Specific Folder
```

### Step 3: Select Folder (if Specific Folder chosen)
```
? Select a folder to organize:
❯ 📁 Notes
  📁 Projects  
  📁 Archive/2024
  📁 Archive/2023
  📁 Resources/Images
  ❌ Cancel
```

### Step 4: Preview and Confirm
```
📊 Found 15 markdown files in selected folder
? Organize 15 files in 'Notes'? (Y/n)
```

❯ 📅 By Date Created

```

### Step 6: Organization Execution

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Key Components

#### `selectTargetFolder()` Method
- Discovers all directories in vault
- Filters out system/excluded folders
- Provides interactive selection interface
- Shows file count preview

#### `getDirectories()` Method
- Recursively scans directory structure
- Applies filtering rules
- Returns sorted list of valid directories

#### `shouldSkipDirectory()` Method
- Filters out system folders (`.obsidian`, `.git`, etc.)
- Excludes already organized folders
- Prevents infinite loops and conflicts

#### `countMarkdownFiles()` Method
- Counts markdown files in specific directory
- Provides preview information
- Handles error cases gracefully

### Enhanced `organize()` Method
- **Dual path support**: Handles both target path and vault root
- **Flexible file discovery**: Works with entire vault or specific folder
- **Proper organization**: Maintains organized structure at vault root

## 📁 Folder Structure

### Before Organization
```
vault/
├── Notes/
│   ├── daily-note-2024-01-15.md
│   ├── meeting-notes.md
│   └── project-ideas.md
├── Archive/
│   └── old-notes.md
└── Resources/
    └── references.md
```

### After Organizing "Notes" Folder by Date
```
vault/
├── Notes/                    # Original folder (empty after move)
├── Archive/                  # Untouched
├── Resources/                # Untouched  
└── organized/
    └── by-date/
        ├── 2024/
        │   └── 2024-01/
        │       └── daily-note-2024-01-15.md
        └── general/
            ├── meeting-notes.md
            └── project-ideas.md
